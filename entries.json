Then went home for half an hour before heading off to work, I was originally gonna do my VPN lab for cosine, but ended up making this app right here! Took me ages but was super fun to make and I think it looks awesome! especially with the jQuery stuff, hopefully gonna be a boss at it soon. Came home and had steak w\/ Katie w\/ peppercorn sauce! Watched some yu gi oh abridged then been sat here all evening finishing off this app. Upstairs are noisy as shit! Stupid drunk tossers!"}}
